project name:     Book Search

My project is a simple book search which shows list of book titles, autors and pictures 
using title provided by user in the search bar.
I'm using google book API to achive this goal and also I'm using Bootstrap library to style
my web page.
In this project I'm trying to use React's main features like independent components and proper
loop functions in order to visualize them neatly on the page.
